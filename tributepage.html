    <section id="tribute-info"><h2>Premise</h2>
        Set in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department in Brooklyn, Brooklyn Nine-Nine
        follows a team of detectives headed by the serious and intellectual Captain Raymond Holt. The detectives include
        Jake Peralta, an investigator with a high rate of solved cases despite his relaxed and often childish attitude,
        who eventually falls for his nerdy, by-the-book, but skilled partner, Amy Santiago. Jake's best friend, the
        timid and loyal Charles Boyle, is often partnered with the intense and aggressive Rosa Diaz. The two older
        detectives, Michael Hitchcock and Norm Scully, often seem incompetent and lazy, but were once legendary
        detectives. The detectives report to Sergeant, later Lieutenant, Terry Jeffords, a gentle giant and devoted
        family man. For the first five seasons and the initial episodes of the sixth, the precinct also includes
        sarcastic and dominating civilian administrator Gina Linetti, who dislikes her job, plans her life around social
        media, and focuses on dancing as a life goal.
